This folder contains the following files, relevant to the paper "A Correlation Between the Final Separation and Mass Ratio from Common Envelope Simulations": 

-- 13 .dat files containing the time evolution of the final separation (one for each simulation),

-- 13 .dat files containing the time evolution of the unbound mass fraction (one for each simulation),

-- Two .dat files with the simulations presented in Tables 3 and 4,

-- A Python script "generate_fig.py" to generate Figure 7.

To run generate_fig.py, one need to download "datafile3a.txt" from Kruckow et al., 2021 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac13ac#apjac13act3)
